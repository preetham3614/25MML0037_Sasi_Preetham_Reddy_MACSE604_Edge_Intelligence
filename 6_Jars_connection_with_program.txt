6 Jars 
============== 

1. Data Jar 	==>  	All the Log Data that we have in our csv file which contains 7.2 lakh records with 3 features
2. Task Jar 	==> 	Here our main task is to find the anamolies in the log data . 
3. Model Jar 	==> 	Here in order to create the labels we will do clustering and create labels for each records then we use a classifier 			to classify the logs as anamolies or not 


Rest of the jars are not yet mapped.
